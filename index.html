							<h2>Welcome to my portfolio</h2>
							<article class="major" style="text-align: left;">
								
								<p>Hi, my name is Tansylu. I am a second year student majoring in Computer science at Sabanci University in Istanbul, Turkey.
									<p>Besides studying, I have always been searching
										 for opportunities  to grow my skill and a career in technology.
									<p>It started with a 2 year object-oriented programming 
										in Python program offered by Yandex back in 
										my homecity in Russia. I learned how to build Telegram-bots, set up Flask servers and webhooks, and built a game in tkinter as a graduation project.</p>
									</p>
									
									<p> Later I became a part of founding members of our local youth community called UrbanTatar.
										In an effort to build the first radio with music in my native Tatar language, 
										I taught myself how to write apps in Dart within the Flutter framework.
										This resulted in the <a href="#first">UrbanTatar Radio app </a>being published in both App Store and Google Play,
										 alongside 3 other educational apps for learning Tatar language, made by me.
									</p>
									
									<p> Then, in 2021 I started university and found an amazing internship at <a href="https://www.layermark.com/winner-smart-water-project-of-the-year/"></a>Layermark as part of the EMS team. 
										Here, I was responsible for building the mobile version of an existing event management platform for DC Water company using Flutter.
									Couple months later I have successfully completed the app, and the details are available in my <a href="#work">portfolio.</a></p>
									
									<p>More recently, I have been transferred to the AI team at the company to work on building a desktop application for a computer vision utility. 
										We are working with the Electron.js framework, using React and html/css technologies.
									</p>
									<p> Currently, I am continuing my CS degree and applying for a summer internship within the Erasmus+ exchange program.</p>

							<strong> Event Management System Mobile</strong>
							<a href="https://www.layermark.com/event-management-system/"> Project description</a>
								<p>Layermarkâ€™s Event Management System (EMS) is an existing product that enables organizations such as DC Water to
									 tackle the issue of severe weather conditions and ageing infrastructure. </p>
								<p>I was tasked with implementing the modile version of the 
									web-application for use by high level executives with the advantage of accesibility "on the go"</p>
							<p> The app offers 2 dashboards: FloodTrack  and WaterTrack.
								It allows DC Water to monitor and respond to an emergency faster by using data from multiple real-time feeds. This helps to
								 identify the location and severity of a problem and determine which crews to dispatch to which locations.
							</p>
							<p>The dashboards include:
								<ul>
									<li> Geo map with markers for reported incidents and work orders</li>
								<li>Alert level visualization through border color and incident count boxes per map area</li>
								<li>Incident/Work order details card onclick of the marker</li>
								<li>Incidents/Work orders list with filtering and search capabilities</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>Additionally, the app utilizes user management and authorization.	
							The data is fetched from the backend services to be represented on the dashboards live time.</p>
